    each planet is interacting with each other at that moment in time. This conversation
    can provide rich insight into how certain parts of yourself can work well or against
    themselves in your life. The color of each line as well as the overall shape they
    create speak to the amount of effort needed in life to accomplish certain goals,
    as well as the amount of dynamism inherent in the personality. Every chart is
    uniquely different in its pattern, but common themes do arise with regularly occurring
    shapes. In this analysis we will explore each major aspect shape, it’s energetic
    quality, as well as the planets and houses involved.
